# New-Line-Art-Designer
New Line Art Designer is an interactive art design program. It allows for the user to view and modify various elements of a moving, linear art design in a GUI window that is launched when the program is run.

## Requirements
Ukulele Chimes orequires the following package to run:<br />
* PyQt5<br />

## How It Works
The user initiates the design by pressing either the left or right arrow key (to move the image backwards or forward respectively). 
The initial design consists of several sqaures rotated around the center of the window, creating a circle. 
The squares slowly expand, making the pattern more intricate.
Several elements of the design may be altered, such as the speed of the movement, width of the rectagles, number of rectangles, 
proximity of the sqaures to the center of the image, and thickness of the lines that make up the sqaures.
Additionally, several arithmetic and trigonometric operators may be altered and/or applied to the code that creates the design, allowing for immense diversity.

Alterations to the design are made with designated key presses, which are displayed in the bottom left of the window. 
Key presses are used instead of buttons in the GUI in order to reduce clutter. 
The current value of various elements of the design are displayed next to their corresponding controls.
The font size of the controls may be adjusted, or removed from the window.

This is the initial design immediately after the user presses the "Forward" key (right arrow):

Here is the design after a few seconds:

Here are just a few samples of the design after alterations have been made:
